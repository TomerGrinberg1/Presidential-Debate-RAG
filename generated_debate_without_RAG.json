        "question": "And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin the debate. And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?",
        "real_answer": "We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over. The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now. In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's \u2013 things were in chaos, literally chaos. And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year. And the situation is making \u2013 and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of \u2013 around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.",

I mean, I've been there myself. Growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, my family struggled to make ends meet. I know what it's like to worry about how you're gonna pay the bills.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Joe, you're just making excuses.\" But let me tell you, I'm not here to make excuses. I'm here to tell you that we're facing a global economic crisis, and it's not just about inflation. It's about the structural changes that have been happening in our economy for decades. We've got to address the root causes of this crisis, not just the symptoms.\n\nNow, I know some of my opponents, including my opponent on the stage tonight, might say that we need to cut taxes and regulations to fix this problem. But let me tell you, that's not the way to do it. We need to invest in the American people, not just the wealthy and powerful. We need to invest in education, in training programs, in infrastructure, and in healthcare.\n\nYou see, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we were faced with a choice: cut taxes and regulations, or invest in our people. And we chose to invest. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which helped to save millions of jobs, got money to small businesses, and put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nAnd you know what? It worked. The economy started to grow, and we started to see a slowdown in inflation. But we're not done yet. We need to keep building on that progress. We need to keep investing in our people, and we need to keep pushing for a fair economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful.\n\nSo, to those voters who feel they're worse off under my presidency, I want to say this: I hear you. I see you. And I'm committed to doing better. We're going to keep working together to build an economy that's fair, that's just, and that works for every American family. Thank you."

First, I agree that we had a strong economy before COVID-19 hit. We were on a roll, and Americans were feeling good about their futures.

I worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass the American Rescue Plan, which provided relief to families, small businesses, and communities that were struggling.\n\nAnd let me tell you, it made a difference.

And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt. So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?",

It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet.

It's a serious issue, no question. But it's not a new issue. It's been growing for decades, and it's a result of a combination of factors, including tax policies that have benefited the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\n\nNow, I understand that President Trump is trying to spin his tax cuts as a success, but the reality is that they've added trillions to our national debt. And let me tell you why: because they benefited corporations and the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. They didn't create jobs, they just shifted wealth from the middle class to the top 1%.\n\nAnd what's even more concerning is that President Trump's policies have done nothing to address the root causes of our national debt. He's just added to the problem with his reckless spending and tax policies that favor the wealthy.\n\nNow, I'm not going to promise you a magic solution to our national debt. But I will tell you that I have a plan to address it in a way that's fair and responsible. We're going to make sure that corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. We're going to invest in education and job training programs that will help Americans acquire the skills they need to compete in the 21st century economy. And we're going to make sure that our tax policies benefit the middle class, not just the wealthy.\n\nFolks, I know we can do better than this. We can build an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. We can create a future where every American has access to good-paying jobs, affordable healthcare, and a secure retirement. And we can do it without breaking the bank or saddling future generations with debt.\n\nSo, let's get back to basics.

These are programs that have been a cornerstone of our social safety net for decades, and they're a testament to our country's commitment to taking care of one another. (emphasizing) But I want to talk about what's really at stake here.\n\nAs President, I've seen firsthand the impact that these programs have on American families. I've met with seniors who rely on Medicare to get the medical care they need. I've spoken to families who are counting on Social Security to make ends meet. And I've seen the devastating effect that cuts to these programs can have on our communities.\n\nNow, I understand that the President has concerns about immigration, and I share some of those concerns. But the answer is not to cut Medicare and Social Security, which would hurt millions of Americans who are counting on these programs. The answer is to work together to create a comprehensive immigration reform that addresses our country's needs while also protecting the programs that have been a lifeline for so many. (firmly) And I'm committed to doing just that.\n\nAs for the President's comments about foreign countries, I couldn't disagree more. I've met with leaders from around the world, and I know that they respect the United States not because of our military might or our economic power, but because of our values and our commitment to the well-being of our citizens and the people of the world. (emphasizing) We're a beacon of hope and freedom, and we should be proud of that.\n\nSo, let's focus on building a country that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and the powerful. Let's work together to create a healthcare system that's truly universal, that covers every American from birth to death. Let's strengthen Social Security and Medicare, so that we can take care of our seniors and our most vulnerable citizens. And let's show the world that we're a country that values compassion, empathy, and the common good.

I've spent my career working on this issue, and I've always believed that we need to approach it with compassion, with empathy, and with a commitment to fairness.\n\nNow, I know that my administration has faced some challenges on the border, and I take full responsibility for that. We've been working tirelessly to address the root causes of migration, to strengthen our borders, and to provide a more humane and efficient system for those seeking asylum.\n\nLet me tell you a story about a young family I met in El Paso, Texas. They were fleeing violence in their home country, and they had been waiting in Mexico for months, just hoping to get a chance to apply for asylum. When they finally made it to the border, they were met with a system that was overwhelmed and under-resourced. But with our help, we were able to provide them with a safe and fair process to apply for asylum, and ultimately, they were able to build a new life in America.\n\nThat's what we need to be doing, folks. We need to be addressing the root causes of migration, providing more resources to our border communities, and building a system that's fair, efficient, and compassionate.\n\nNow, I know some of my opponents want to focus on building walls and dividing families. But I'm committed to a different approach. I'm committed to working with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, that strengthens our borders, and that protects our values as a nation of immigrants.\n\nWe can do this, folks. We can build a more just and equitable immigration system that works for everyone. We can provide a safe and fair process for those seeking asylum, and we can keep our communities safe and secure. We can do it by working together, with compassion, with empathy, and with a commitment to our shared values as Americans."

We're living in a country that's been plagued by systemic injustices, inequality, and a lack of access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. That's what's led to the migration crisis, not because people are seeking to harm us, but because they're seeking a chance to build a better life.\n\nRegarding the loss of life at our border, I agree that it's a tragedy. But let's not forget that these are human beings, with names and stories, who are fleeing violence, persecution, and poverty. We can't just throw up our hands and say it's someone else's problem. We have a moral obligation to help those in need.\n\nNow, I want to talk about the specifics of our policies. We've invested in border security, including technology, infrastructure, and personnel to ensure that we're keeping our borders safe while also treating those who are seeking asylum with dignity and respect.\n\nWe've also taken steps to address the root causes of migration, including poverty, violence, and corruption in countries like Honduras and Guatemala. We've provided over $4 billion in aid to those countries to help them address these issues and create opportunities for their people to stay and build a better life at home.\n\nAnd let's not forget about our veterans. We've made significant investments in veterans' healthcare, education, and employment, and we've worked to reduce the backlog of claims and improve the overall quality of care at the VA.\n\n(Firmly) I understand that this is a complex issue, and there are no easy answers.

Both of you have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable? ## previous response from trump: \n Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that's why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him. The other thing is, he doesn't fire people. He never fired people. I've never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn't put him there. I didn't put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him. This guy hasn't fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan \u2013 the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn't fire? Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that's on the border, that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn't be a debate. He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. He's destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he's trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out \u2013 came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It's insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don't think \u2013 we just can't let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won't have a country left anymore. That's how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.",

One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That's a fact. That's not conjecture. He can argue the wrong, but that's what they voted. The idea that he is knowing (ph) \u2013 doing anything to deal with child care. He did very \u2013 virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.

The cost of childcare is a real challenge for many American families, and it's a problem that requires a serious solution.\n\nAs I've said before, we need to make childcare more affordable and accessible to working families. That's why I've proposed a plan to provide high-quality, affordable childcare to every family in America. We'll make sure that every child can get the care they need to succeed, and every parent can get back to work with peace of mind.\n\nHere's how we'll do it: we'll increase funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, so that more families can access affordable childcare. We'll also create a new tax credit for low- and moderate-income families, so they can get a break on the cost of childcare. And we'll make sure that childcare providers are paid a living wage, so they can provide the high-quality care that our children need.\n\nBut this isn't just about the numbers \u2013 it's about the people. It's about the single mom who's working two jobs just to make ends meet, and can't afford to send her kids to a safe and nurturing after-school program. It's about the child who's stuck in a subpar daycare center, because their parents can't afford better. And it's about the family who's struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, because they don't have access to the support they need.\n\nWe can do better than this. We can build an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. We can invest in our children, and in the future of our country. And we can start by making childcare more affordable and accessible to every American family.\n\nSo, let's get back to the task at hand. Let's work together to make a difference in the lives of American families."

We need to recognize that addiction is a disease, not a moral failing. We need to invest in treatment, not just punishment. And we need to make sure that every American, regardless of income or geography, has access to the care they need.\n\nThat's why, as president, I would make addressing addiction a top priority. I would increase funding for evidence-based treatment programs, expand access to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and invest in community-based initiatives that provide support for families and individuals struggling with addiction.\n\nBut we also need to address the root causes of addiction, like poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and the trauma that many Americans face. That's why I would also invest in programs that promote economic opportunity, provide mental health services, and support our veterans who are disproportionately affected by addiction.\n\nI want to share a personal story with you. I've met so many families who have lost loved ones to addiction, but I've also met so many families who have found hope and healing through treatment. I've visited treatment centers, spoken with counselors and therapists, and learned about the incredible work that's being done to address this crisis.\n\nWe can do better, America.

But this guy is \u2013 has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after \u2013 when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything comes into the United States America. What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with \u2013 and get rid of the ability of Medicare to \u2013 for the ability to \u2013 for the \u2013 us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it \u2013 we got it down to 15 \u2013 excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u2013 how much prescription they need. You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u2013 debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices. I'm going to make that available to every senior, all \u2013 or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have \u2013 I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.

As I look out at all of you, I'm reminded of the incredible diversity and resilience of the American people. And I'm proud to say that my fellow debater and I share a commitment to serving this great nation.\n\n(Looking directly at the audience) As we stand here tonight, I want to talk about the state of our country. We're at a crossroads. We can choose to continue down the path of division, of anger, and of fear. Or we can choose a different way \u2013 a way of unity, of hope, and of opportunity for all.\n\n(Charging ahead with conviction) As your President, I've dedicated my life to fighting for the middle class, for workers, and for families who are struggling to make ends meet. That's why I've worked tirelessly to pass the American Rescue Plan, to create jobs, to lower healthcare costs, and to make sure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.\n\n(Using a personal anecdote) I think about my own family, my late son Beau, who struggled with addiction. I think about the countless families who are struggling to find affordable care for their loved ones. And I know that we can do better. That's why I've committed to expanding Medicaid, to protecting the Affordable Care Act, and to making sure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare.\n\n(Emphasizing the importance of unity) This isn't just a partisan issue; it's a human issue. Every single American deserves to have access to quality healthcare, regardless of their zip code or their bank account. Every single American deserves a fair shot at success, regardless of the color of their skin or the language they speak.\n\n(Raising his voice with conviction) So, my fellow Americans, as we stand here tonight, I want to ask you: what kind of future do you want for our country? Do you want a future of division and strife, or a future of unity and hope? Do you want a future where everyone has access to quality healthcare, or a future where some people are left behind?\n\n(Smiling with determination) I know the answer. I know that we can do better. And I know that together, we can build a brighter future for ourselves, for our children, and for generations to come. Thank you."

He doesn't do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn't stop \u2013 Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it. For three-and-a-half years, we're living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don't respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don't respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re \u2013 rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we've done, nobody's ever \u2013 never seen anything like \u2013 even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You signed a document. They've been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they're living. And that's why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u2013 we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore.

The best jobs, the greatest jobs, the highest paying jobs. And I've done it all without increasing your taxes. Nobody, nobody, making under $400,000 has paid a single penny more in taxes. That's what I call fairness.\n\nAnd let me tell you about the border, it's a mess, a complete mess. I've built a wall, a beautiful wall, and I've made Mexico pay for it. Believe me, folks, no one else could have done it. And I've secured our border like no one else.
