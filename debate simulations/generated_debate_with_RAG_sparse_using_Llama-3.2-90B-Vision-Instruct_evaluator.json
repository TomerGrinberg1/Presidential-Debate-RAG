        "question": "And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin the debate. And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?",
        "real_answer": "We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over. The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now. In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's \u2013 things were in chaos, literally chaos. And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year. And the situation is making \u2013 and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of \u2013 around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.",

I know that many Americans are feeling the pinch of high prices and inflation. But I also know that we're making progress, and I want to give you the whole story.First, let me say that I understand why people are feeling down. It's been a tough few years, with the pandemic and all the uncertainty that came with it. But I want to remind everyone that we've created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, and we're better off than virtually any other major nation in the world. We're investing in clean energy, we're investing in infrastructure, and we're working to make sure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare.Now, I know that prices are still high, and I take that very seriously. But let's look at the facts. We're not just talking about food and housing prices; we're also talking about the cost of healthcare, the cost of education, and the cost of childcare. And let's not forget, we're also talking about the fact that the wealthiest 1% of Americans are getting a bigger share of the benefits, while the middle class and the poor are getting left behind.But here's the thing: we're not just focused on short-term fixes. We're focused on long-term solutions. We're working to create a more equitable economy, where everyone has access to the opportunities they deserve. And that's exactly why we're investing in things like affordable housing, education, and training programs.Now, I know that some of my opponents might say that we're not doing enough, but the truth is, we're making progress. We're making progress on trade, we're making progress on jobs, and we're making progress on the environment. And I'm proud of the work we've done so far.But I want to make one thing clear: we're not done yet. We need to keep working to make sure that everyone has access to the opportunities they deserve. We need to keep working to address the root causes of inflation and to make sure that everyone can afford the essentials. And we need to keep working to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful.So, I say to the American people: don't give up. We're making progress, and we're going to keep working to make sure that everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream. Thank you."

With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?",

It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u2013 that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with, we \u2013 we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore. We're like a Third World nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent. All of the things he's done. We've become like a Third World nation, and it's a shame.

I'd like to address the issue of the national debt and the economy, and I'll do my best to provide a concise and accurate response.Firstly, I want to say that I disagree with the premise that President Trump's policies led to a great economy prior to COVID. While it's true that the economy was growing during that period, I believe that this growth was largely due to a combination of factors, including monetary policy, the expansion of the existing economy, and the fact that we were coming out of a recession.However, it's also true that the tax cuts implemented during the Trump administration did contribute to the growth of the economy, at least in the short term. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered the corporate tax rate from 39% to 21%, which did stimulate economic growth. However, this growth was largely concentrated in the top 1% of earners, and the benefits of the tax cuts were not evenly distributed across the economy.Moreover, the national debt has continued to grow under President Trump's policies, and we are now facing a national debt of over $28 trillion. This debt is a serious concern, and it's essential that we take steps to address it. As President, I have proposed a comprehensive plan to reduce the national debt, including investments in clean energy, infrastructure, and education, as well as reforms to our tax code and healthcare system.In contrast to President Trump's approach, my plan prioritizes the needs of the middle class and working families, and it will create good-paying jobs, raise the minimum wage, and provide access to affordable healthcare for all Americans. I believe that this is a more equitable and sustainable approach to managing our national debt and promoting economic growth.I'd like to emphasize that my approach is focused on building an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. I believe that we can create a more prosperous and equitable economy by investing in our people, our infrastructure, and our future, and I'm committed to working with Congress to make this vision a reality.

We can choose a different path, a path that uplifts the middle class, that protects the progress we've made on healthcare, and that ensures that every American has access to quality, affordable care.Now, I know my opponent would have you believe that we're destroying Medicare and Social Security. But let me tell you, that's just not true. Our plan is to strengthen these programs, to make sure they're there for the next generation. We're going to do it by investing in the Affordable Care Act, by closing the Medicare donut hole, and by making sure that our seniors have the healthcare they deserve.And let's be clear, this isn't just about numbers, it's about people. It's about the single mom who's working two jobs to make ends meet, but still can't afford healthcare for her kids. It's about the senior who's struggling to pay for their medication. It's about the family who's trying to plan for the future, but is worried that they'll be left with nothing.We can do better, America. We can do better than a system that puts profits over people.

The numbers are staggering. A record number of migrants are crossing the border, and you're asking why people should trust you to solve this crisis? Well, let me tell you, it's because you're not a leader, you're a politician. You're more interested in scoring cheap political points than in doing what's right for the American people.Let me remind you, when I was president, we built a wall, a wall that was beautiful, a wall that was strong, a wall that was effective. And you know what? It worked. It reduced the number of people crossing the border by 40%. But no, you, President Biden, you came along and tore it down, literally and figuratively. You ended the Remain in Mexico policy, which was a huge success. You ended the asylum reform, which was a huge success. And you opened up the floodgates, folks, you opened up the floodgates.So, let me ask you, President Biden, how can you expect the American people to trust you to solve this crisis when you've shown no leadership, no vision, and no willingness to do what it takes to secure our border? It's simple, folks, the answer is they can't. They can't trust you because you're not a leader, you're a politician, and politicians don't care about the American people.So, I'm asking the American people, don't trust him, trust me. I know what it takes to build a secure border, and I know what it takes to fix this crisis. I've done it before, and I can do it again. Believe me, folks, it's going to be huge. Just huge."

I know we can make a difference in the broader American society.Let's be honest, we came into office in 2021 with a lot of unfinished business. We faced four years of pandemic, economic inequality, and systemic racism. We had to deal with the aftermath of January 6th, and the damage that was done to our democracy. But we've made significant strides.First, we addressed the economy. We created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We invested in small businesses, particularly in Black communities, and saw the highest rate of creation of new Black small businesses in years. We capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors, including insulin, at $35 a month. And we've invested in programs to support Black-owned businesses, like the Black Business Loan Fund.Second, we invested in healthcare. We expanded Medicaid and CHIP to cover more low-income families, and we invested in programs to address the maternal mortality crisis in Black communities. We've also invested in education, with a focus on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and programs to support Black students, like the HBCU-Career Project.And third, we addressed the justice system. We worked to address the racial disparities in our justice system, and invested in programs to support reentry and reintegration of former prisoners into their communities. We also signed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the right to vote for all Americans.Now, I know this isn't enough. I know we've got more work to do to address the racial wealth gap, to address the systemic racism that exists in our society. We need to create more opportunities for Black families and Black communities to build wealth, to create more jobs, to invest in education and healthcare. And we need to do it now.That's why in my second term, I'll build on the progress we've made, and make sure we address the persistent challenges that you face. We'll pass the Police Reform and Accountability Act, to hold police officers accountable for their actions. We'll invest in community-based programs to address the root causes of crime. And we'll work to address the racial wealth gap, by investing in programs to support Black-owned businesses, and creating more opportunities for Black families to build wealth.I know we can do it.

Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can't, in the 1990s (ph), we can't forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was \u2013 incredibly did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that's why we have the best numbers with them. And maybe ever, if they're saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs? And it's already started.

We should be offering them a path to safety and a chance to rebuild their lives, not demonizing them.As for the VA, I'm proud of the work we're doing to improve healthcare for our veterans, including increasing funding for the VA and supporting initiatives to reduce homelessness among veterans.

We'll provide incentives for them to invest in childcare programs that serve low-income families, and we'll make sure that they have the resources they need to do it.Now, I know some of my opponents might say that these proposals are too expensive, that they're not the right solution. But let me tell you, folks, this is not a luxury, this is a necessity. Every family deserves access to affordable childcare, and we need to make it happen.And let me tell you, it's not just about the cost, it's about the future of our country. When families can afford childcare, they're more likely to work, they're more likely to participate in their communities, and they're more likely to contribute to the economy.So, let's get to work on this. Let's make childcare more affordable for American families. It's time we put the needs of families first and make sure that every child has access to the care they need to thrive.And let me add, as I've always said, we're not just talking about childcare, we're talking about a fundamental right. Every child deserves access to quality, affordable childcare, and we need to make it happen.Thank you."

I'm going to make that available to every senior, all \u2013 or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have \u2013 I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare.

We've made historic investments in our country's future, from clean energy to infrastructure, and created jobs for good-paying jobs for millions of Americans. We've passed laws that have improved the lives of working families, from lower prescription drug costs to the PACT Act, which will help our veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.We've also made progress on the issues that matter most to Americans, from climate change to gun violence. We've seen a decline in gun violence, and we must continue to work together to keep our communities safe.I want to thank the American people for their trust in me, and I want to thank the supporters who have stood by me throughout this campaign. I'm committed to building on the progress we've made, and I'm committed to working with both parties to find common ground.As we move forward, we must remember that we're not just building a better America for the future, we're building a better America for every American.

He doesn't do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn't stop \u2013 Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it. For three-and-a-half years, we're living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don't respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don't respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re \u2013 rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we've done, nobody's ever \u2013 never seen anything like \u2013 even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You signed a document. They've been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they're living. And that's why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u2013 we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore.
