        "question": "And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let's begin the debate. And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?",
        "real_answer": "We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over. The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now. In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's \u2013 things were in chaos, literally chaos. And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year. And the situation is making \u2013 and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of \u2013 around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.",

            "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct": "Thank you for having me here tonight. I understand that folks are feeling the pinch, and I want to address that directly. Let me tell you, I hear you, just like I heard from my parents, Catherine and Joe Biden, growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. We were a family that worked hard, and we knew what it meant to struggle with making ends meet.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: we didn't get into this economy overnight, and we're not going to get out of it overnight either. But I'm proud of the progress we've made. When I took office, we were facing a pandemic that had shut down the global economy, and supply chains were broken. It was a perfect storm that led to inflation. But we took action, and we've seen results.\n\nWe've helped to address supply chain bottlenecks, and we've seen input costs come down. And while prices are still high, they're not where they were when we first took office. The data shows that inflation has fallen by about two-thirds, and in some areas, it's even fallen by more. And let me tell you, we're not done yet.\n\nWe're committed to lowering costs for families, and that's why we've put forward a comprehensive plan to lower costs across the economy. It's not just about prices; it's about giving families more breathing room. We're talking about a plan that saves families thousands of dollars a year on groceries, gas, healthcare, housing, transportation, and more.\n\nNow, I know some of my opponents would have you believe that they have a magic solution to bring costs down, but the truth is, they don't. They'd rather give big corporations and the ultra-wealthy special breaks while raising costs for everyone else. That's not a recipe for prosperity; that's a recipe for more suffering.\n\nWe're not going to let that happen. We're going to keep working to build an economy that gives families more choices, more opportunities, and more security. We're going to keep fighting to give families the chance to make ends meet, to save for their children's education, and to retire with dignity.\n\nSo, to the voters who feel they're worse off under my presidency than they were under President Trump, I want to say this: I hear you, and I'm with you. We're not done yet, but we're making progress. We're going to keep working to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected. Thank you."

So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?",

It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u2013 that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet.

[chuckles]\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the national debt. We all agree that we need to get our debt under control. But when I ran for president, I promised the American people that we would do it in a way that was fair and balanced, not just by cutting taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, which is what President Trump did. We need to make sure that everyone pays their fair share.\n\nUnder President Trump's tax plan, the top 1% of earners got a massive tax cut, while middle-class families saw their taxes go up. And as a result, we saw a massive increase in the national debt. We had to borrow more money to finance the tax cuts, which is why we saw a huge increase in the debt.\n\nNow, I know President Trump's going to say that the economy was great before COVID, and that's true. But let me tell you, we were on a path to have a recession even before COVID hit. And COVID just accelerated that trend.\n\nThe truth is, we need to invest in the American people, not just the wealthy and large corporations. We need to invest in education, infrastructure, and healthcare. We need to make sure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare, and that we're not just leaving behind the people who need it the most.\n\nAnd let's be clear, we're not going to get our debt under control by just cutting programs that help the American people. That's a recipe for disaster. We need to have a balanced approach that includes both spending cuts and tax fairness.\n\nSo, I'd love to compare my record to President Trump's on this issue. I've spent my entire career working to make sure that the economy works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful. I've passed legislation to help working families, to protect the environment, and to make sure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare.\n\nSo, let's talk about the facts, not the fiction.

It's not a partisan issue; it's a humanitarian issue, a moral issue, and an economic issue. The truth is, the record number of migrants crossing the border is a symptom of a larger problem \u2013 a problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\n\nNow, I know some of my opponents would have you believe that I'm not serious about border security, that I'm not taking this crisis seriously. But let me tell you, I have been to the border, and I've seen firsthand the challenges we face. I've met with law enforcement, and I've spoken to the families who are seeking a better life in America.\n\nAs President, I've taken concrete actions to address this crisis. I've proposed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, increases border security, and reforms our asylum system. I've also invested in technology and infrastructure to enhance border security, including sensors, drones, and additional Border Patrol agents.\n\nBut here's the thing: we need a bipartisan solution. We can't solve this crisis alone, and we can't solve it by demonizing immigrants. We need to work together, to find common ground, and to create a system that is fair, humane, and effective.\n\nAnd let me be clear: the numbers you're citing are staggering, but they're not the only measure of success. We need to focus on the root causes of migration, not just the symptoms. We need to address the violence, the poverty, and the inequality that drive people to flee their homes.\n\nSo, I ask you, my fellow Americans, to look at the facts. Look at the number of migrants who have been detained, who have been deported, and who have been helped by our government. Look at the investments we've made in border security and in the communities affected by this crisis.\n\nAnd I ask you to trust me, because I've spent my career fighting for the American people. I've spent my career working across the aisle to find common ground. I've spent my career standing up for the marginalized and the oppressed.\n\nSo, yes, I know we have a long way to go. But I also know that we can do this. We can solve this crisis, and we can do it together. Thank you."

As I've said before, I've been working tirelessly with my team, with Israel, with Egypt, and with other regional partners to bring about a ceasefire and a hostage deal. \n\nFirstly, let me be clear: I've been unequivocal in my support for Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas's brutal attacks. As I've said, Hamas's actions are unconscionable, and we will not stand idly by as they threaten Israel's security and the security of the region. However, I've also been clear that the conflict is causing immense suffering for civilians on both sides, and we have a moral obligation to help mitigate that suffering.\n\nTo that end, I've increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, and we're working to get even more aid in. This includes food, water, medicine, shelter, and other essential necessities. We're also working to evacuate as many civilians as possible from the conflict zone.\n\nNow, I know that Hamas has not yet released the hostages, and Israel's military response has been intense. I want to be clear: I've worked with Israel to dissuade them from using certain types of munitions that could exacerbate the humanitarian situation, and I'll continue to do so. \n\nTo bring about a ceasefire and a hostage deal, I've proposed a two-step process. First, Hamas must release all the hostages, including the five Americans, and demonstrate its commitment to a ceasefire. In exchange, Israel must agree to a complete and comprehensive ceasefire and a halt to its military operations in Gaza. I've made it clear to both parties that this is the only way forward.\n\nTo increase leverage, I've been working with regional partners, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and agree to a ceasefire. We're also working to build a coalition of like-minded countries to support a ceasefire and a hostage deal.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a difficult and complex situation, but I'm committed to doing everything I can to bring about a resolution that ends the suffering of innocent civilians and promotes peace and security in the region.

We'll provide better pay, benefits, and training for caregivers, so they can do their job with dignity and respect.\n\nAnd, I'll work with Congress to pass legislation that incentivizes states to invest in childcare infrastructure, so we can build more child care centers and create good-paying jobs in the industry.\n\nLet me be clear: affordable childcare is not just a moral imperative, it's an economic necessity. When families have access to affordable childcare, they're more likely to work, earn a higher income, and contribute to our economy. And when childcare providers are paid a living wage, they're more likely to stay in the job, provide high-quality care, and support their families.\n\nWe can do this, America. We can make childcare affordable, accessible, and of high quality for every family. It's time to put our money where our mouth is. It's time to put families first. Thank you.\""

But this guy is \u2013 has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after \u2013 when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything comes into the United States America. What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with \u2013 and get rid of the ability of Medicare to \u2013 for the ability to \u2013 for the \u2013 us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it \u2013 we got it down to 15 \u2013 excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u2013 how much prescription they need. You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u2013 debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices. I'm going to make that available to every senior, all \u2013 or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have \u2013 I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country. We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.",

A country where everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare, where our kids can succeed, and where hard work is rewarded. We've made significant progress in this campaign, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished together. But we have more work to do.\n\nJust like I did when I ran for Senate, and my wife Jill and I had to make tough choices to send our children to good schools, we need to make sure every child has access to quality education, from pre-K to college. We need to invest in our infrastructure, in clean energy, and in good-paying jobs.\n\nAnd, as I've said before, my dear friend, my vice president Kamala Harris, she's been an incredible partner to me on this campaign, and I'm so grateful for her leadership. We've traveled this country, and we've seen the resilience and the strength of the American people.\n\nSo, in these final moments, I want to tell you that I believe in you. I believe in your potential, in your kindness, and in your decency. I believe we can do hard things, and we can do them together. We can heal our nation, we can unite our people, and we can make a brighter future for every American.\n\nSo, let's finish this campaign with hope, with joy, and with determination. Let's keep pushing forward, together. We are the United States of America, and we will get through this, together. Thank you.\""

He doesn't do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn't stop \u2013 Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it. For three-and-a-half years, we're living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don't respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don't respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re \u2013 rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we've done, nobody's ever \u2013 never seen anything like \u2013 even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You signed a document. They've been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they're living. And that's why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u2013 we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore. We're going to make it great again.",

I've created the greatest economy this country has ever seen, the greatest jobs numbers, the greatest economic growth.\n\nAnd you know what? We're going to do it again. We're going to make America so strong, so powerful, so prosperous, that you won't even recognize it. We're going to create so many jobs, so many great jobs, that people will be begging to come to work for us. We're going to make sure that America is the envy of the world, and we're going to do it with the best deal, the greatest deal, the biggest deal, on trade.\n\nAnd let me tell you, on the border, we're going to build that wall, a beautiful wall, the best wall, and we're going to make Mexico pay for it, mark my words.
